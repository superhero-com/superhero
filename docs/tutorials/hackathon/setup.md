Follow these setup pages in order to prepare your development environment for building Superhero plugins.

## Setup Steps

1. **[Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md)** - Install required software and tools
2. **[Wallet Setup](./wallet-setup.md)** - Install and configure Superhero Wallet
3. **[Configure Cursor](./configure-cursor.md)** - Set up Cursor with documentation context
4. **[Project Setup](./project-setup.md)** - Clone repositories (Superhero UI, your contracts repo, and optionally Superhero API) and configure workspace
5. **[Backend API Setup](./backend-setup.md)** - Set up backend API repository (optional, only if building backend plugins)

<Tip>
You can complete these steps in any order, but we recommend following them sequentially for the smoothest setup experience. Backend setup is only needed if you're building API plugins for transaction processing or popular feed integration.
