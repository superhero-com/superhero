        comments are conducted via the Extension Superherowallet. The Superhero wallet is a blockchain based application
        on which an account address is generated for user identification. Once the donation and comment are processed,
        they appear on the Website with a hyperlink forwarding to the website the User has tipped. Furthermore, other
        Users on the Website can additionally donate and comment on news added to the Website. Therefore, the account
