      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">I. Company information</h3>
      <p className="text-white/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Superhero.com is an open-source, decentralised protocol deployed on æternity blockchain. The protocol operates
        in a distributed manner, and no single party controls or operates the underlying smart contracts. Users
        interact with the protocol directly, at their own discretion and risk.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Superhero.com LVC, with address Dr. Grass-Strasse 12, Vaduz, 9490 Liechtenstein ("the Company") provides and
        maintains this website and related interfaces (the "Interface") to facilitate access to the protocol. The
        Company does not hold custody of assets, execute transactions on behalf of users, or control the operation of
        the decentralised protocol.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        By using the Interface, you acknowledge that all transactions occur directly on the blockchain, outside the
        control of the Company, and that you remain solely responsible for securing your digital assets, private keys,
        and compliance with applicable laws. By accessing or using the Website, you represent and warrant that you are
        at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher) and have the legal capacity to
        enter into these Terms.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">II. Subject of activity</h3>
      <p className="text-white/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Superhero.com developed a website which reflects as a newsfeed users’ donations and comments to news about
        anything they like on the internet and gives the possibility for other users to actively donate and comment on
        the news available on the newsfeed. This information hub enables users to incentivize informative and accurate
        updates about anything all over the world — whether created by news organizations or regular people. Therefore,
        due to the active role of users, the website is a platform on which real-time global updates about best content
        are shared.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white/80 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Superhero.com allows Users to swap, wrap, and bridge using a decentralised protocol. Swap enables users to
        directly exchange native AE tokens and AEX-9 tokens with each other. Transactions are executed directly on-chain,
        are irreversible, and users retain full responsibility for their assets and keys. Wrap converts AE into wrapped
        AE (wAE) for DeFi use, and back again when needed. ETH Bridge lets users move native ETH from the Ethereum
        blockchain into æternity as æETH, which is then automatically swapped into AE tokens. Pool — users provide
        liquidity into pools that power the decentralized exchange (DEX) swaps, and they share in the transaction fees.
        All these features operate directly from the user’s wallet to on-chain smart contracts, without intermediaries.
        They are trustless, meaning users stay in control of their assets at all times.
      </p>
